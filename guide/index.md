# Introduction

In modern cloud computing environments, infrastructure management and deployment have become increasingly complex. To address this complexity, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has emerged as a widely adopted practice. This guide will introduce how to apply the principles of IaC to the ACP (Alauda Container Platform) and leverage Terraform, a powerful IaC tool, to achieve automated and standardized infrastructure management.

## Overview of ACP Platform

ACP (Alauda Container Platform) is an advanced cloud platform product built on Kubernetes. It offers a rich set of cloud-native features, enabling organizations to deploy, manage, and scale their applications and services more efficiently. ACP exposes its resources through Kubernetes APIs, providing users with a unified and powerful interface for platform resource operations.

## IaC Concept

Infrastructure as Code is an approach to defining, deploying, and managing infrastructure using code. It treats infrastructure configuration as software code, enabling version control, automated deployment, and consistent management. The key advantages of IaC include:

- Increased deployment speed and efficiency
- Reduced human error
- Enhanced configuration consistency and reproducibility
- Improved collaboration and version control
- Simplified infrastructure management and maintenance

## Introduction to Terraform

Terraform, developed by HashiCorp, is a tool for IaC management that allows users to manage infrastructure and business applications using a declarative language. Terraform's support for a wide range of cloud service providers and its active community ecosystem make it an ideal choice for managing complex infrastructure.

## The Perfect Combination of ACP and Terraform

As a Kubernetes-based cloud platform, ACP is naturally suited for IaC management approaches. By integrating Terraform with the ACP platform, users can easily achieve automated management and version control of ACP resources, making ACP management and maintenance more reliable and efficient.
